    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easy to make enchiladas, can be made with beef, chicken, or cheese and can be made in only 7 steps! Might not be authentic Mexican Enchiladas as I am caucasian. But I tried.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) jars prepared salsa</li>
        <li> 1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) jar prepared salsa con queso</li>
        <li> 20 (8 inch) flour tortillas </li>
        <li> 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li> 
        <li>Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish, and pour the salsa into the bottom of the dish. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until meat is browned and crumbly.</li> 
        <li>Drain the grease from the beef, and add the salsa con queso to the skillet, stirring to mix well.</li> 
        <li>Place about 2 tablespoons of the beef mixture down the center of each tortilla, roll the tortillas, and place them seam side down on top of the salsa in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of the enchiladas.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is browned and the enchiladas are hot and bubbling.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Editor's Note</h3>
    <p>You can make this recipe with cheese, ground, or shredded chicken, steak, or shredded beef instead of ground beef.</p>
